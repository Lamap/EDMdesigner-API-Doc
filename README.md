EDMdesigner-API
===============

[EDMdesigner](http://www.edmdesigner.com) is a drag and drop tool for creating responsive HTML e-mail templates very quickly and painlessly, radically increasing your click-through rate. This documentation is to give you a detailed description about the EDMdesigner-API with which you can integrate our editor into any web-based system (e.g. a CRM, CMS, WebShop or anything else you can imagine).

To start developing with our api, please request an API_KEY (and a corresponding magic word) at info@edmdesigner.com.

Basically, the only thing you have to do is to implement one side of the handshaking on your server. When the handshaking is done, you can use the sent object, in which you can find the functions that are communicating with our server.

The handshaking is built into the initialization process, so if you implemented the handshaking on your side, everything will work automatically.

We provide example implementations that include the handshaking as well. You can find the continously broading list at the end of this page at the Example implementations section.

Initializing
------------
	
	<script src="path_to_your_jquery.js"></script>
	<script src="http://api.edmdesigner.com/EDMdesignerAPI.js?route=##handshaking_route##"></script>
	<script>
		initEDMdesignerPlugin("##userId##", function(edmDesignerApi) {
			...
		}, onErrorCB);
		
		function onErrorCB(error) {
			console.log(error);
		}
	</script>
	
First of all, jQuery has to be loaded before you load our API. In the second line you can see a route parameter in the script's src. By that you can tell the script where to look for the handshaking implementation. For example, if you implemented it in your index.php, you have to replace ##handshaking_route## with index.php. The first parameter is a user id from your system. It can be any string. In case you don't want to handle separate user accounts, just pass there your API_KEY. The last parameter is an error callback which will be called in every request if the request fails. This is not required thus you can set an error callback in one of your function calls (see later) and in that case it will be called instead of this one.

In the resulting object (edmDesignerApi) you will find some functions through which you can interact with our system.

### Handshaking
To implement the handshaking on your server, you need an API_KEY, a magic word (wich is delivered with your API_KEY), your user's IPv4 address and a timestamp. The logic that handles handshaking has to receive the userId too, because it has to be sent to our server as well. Our API implementation automatically sends the userId in a POST HTTP request. You can set this user id by the first parameter of the initEDMdesignerPlugin.

After concatenating the API_KEY, the IPv4 address of your user, the timestamp (as a string) and your magic word, you have to create an md5 hash of the resulting string.

	
	hash = md5(API_KEY + ipv4 + timestamp + magic)


After this, you have to send the API_KEY, the userId, the IPv4 address, the timestamp and the generated md5 hash to our server at api.edmdesigner.com/api/token through HTTP.

If everything goes well, you get back a token, with which your user can be identified.

# Server side routes
Almost every client side functions have a corresponding route on server side.


## Admin routes

##Authentication
To authenticate these routes, you need to generate a token to a "fake" user called admin.You should send this token and the admin string on every request's query. (like this: ?user=admint&token=token ).Please note that every route need to be authenticated expect the one which generate the token. (//api.edmdesigner.com/api/token)

Example: //api.edmdesigner.com/json/groups/list?user=admin&token=adminToken

### Create handshaking
Create the handshaking between PHP and API needs to be done before any further call
		
		$url = "http://api.edmdesigner.com/api/token";
		$data = array(
			"id"	=> $publicId,
			"uid"	=> $user,
			"ip"	=> $ip,
			"ts"	=> $timestamp,
			"hash"	=> $hash
		);
		
		$options = array(
		    'http' => array(
		        'header'  => "Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\r\n",
		        'method'  => 'POST',
		        'content' => http_build_query($data),

##Gallery handling
If you want to host the uploaded images yourself and want to use your other hosted images as well, then there are a few routes to fulfil this functionality.

Basic operation: The user uploads an image in the api to our server, which uploads it to the given server. This requires you to implement an upload route on your server and [configure](#configure-api-servers-gallery) our server (you have to do the configuration only once). The user can delete the images as well, so there should be an delete route on your server (it should be in the [gallery configuration](#configure-api-servers-gallery)) .

___

### Upload route
You should implement a route on your server which we can use for image upload.

Type: POST

We will upload the images as the following. There will be a "userId" field in the query of the request, it will contain the id of the user (who wants to upload the image). The image will be uplaoded as a file (the field name will be "file") and there will be another field "userId", it will contain the same data as the query field "userId"

The response to our post request should be an image object. The object should have the following properties:
  * url {String} /REQUIRED/ The url where the newly uploaded image can be found.
  * secure_url {String} Http secure version og the image url
  * thumb_url {String} An url where the thumbnail version of the image is available (Tha gallery can work a lot faster if you can provide a thumbnail)
  * name {String} The name of the image. If it is not given then we will you the last segment of the url
  * width {Number} The original width of the image (It can save a lot of process if you can provide this information)
  * height {Number} The original height of the image (It can save a lot of process if you can provide this information)

___

### Delete route
You should implement a route on your server side which we can use for deleting images.

Type: POST

We will post an objact with two parameters:
  * url {String} The url of the deleted image
  * userId {String} The id of the user who deleted the image.

Your response to our post request should be 200. (HTTP status code)

##Headers & footers
You can upload headers and footers which your users will be able to use. A header will appear on the top of their templates and the footer will appear on the bottom.
The users won’t be able to edit these two elements or remove them.  
If you upload any header and/or footer, then the affected users have to use one. If you want to have a group of users who don’t have to use any kind of header and/or footer, then do not upload header and/or footer to all of your users ([general upload](#upload-header-2)) or upload the group an empty header and/or footer. This way they can choose the empty one and then there will be no header and/or footer on their templates.  
You can upload different kind of headers and/or footers. If you do so, then the affected users will be able to choose which header they want to use, but they still have to use one of them.   
The newly created document will get a header and/or footer if the user (who created the project) has any header and/or footer. A user can have header and/or footer if it was uploaded directly to him or to his group or if there are headers and/or footers which were uploaded to every users. (The header and/or footer priority is the following: user’s personal headers and/or footers <  user’s group’s headers and/or footers < general headers and/or footers)

There is three different ways to upload headers. You can upload it:
  - to all your user ([general header upload](#upload-headers-2)) 
  - to a specified group ([upload headers to group](#upload-headers)) 
  - to specified user or users ([upload headers to user](#upload-headers-1))

Footers can be uploaded in the same ways:
  - to everyone ([general footer upload](#upload-footers-2))
  - to a specified group ([upload footers to a group](#upload-footers))
  - to specified user or users ([upload footers to users](#upload-footers-1))


### Structure
The representing object fore header or footer should have the following properties:
  - document {Object} /REQUIRED/ it should be a json object (which represent our templates)
    - root /REQUIRED/ There should be the structure of the header or footer
    - generalSettings
  - id {String} /REQUIRED/ this id is what we use for distinguish the headers from each other so __it should be unique!__ Please note that the id you want to use for the users headers should be different from the ids of the general headers or the ids of the user's group's headers. The same is true for the footers.
  - title {Object} it should contains language code - title string pairs. For example: 'en': 'Green-white header'. The title will appear on the dropdown list. If you don't want to use any other localization then please use the 'en' language code, the default will always be the 'en' regardless of the actual language!  
  - placeholders {Object} it is needed when you want to have more than one supported language on your headers or footers. If you want to know how do the placeholders work please read the [localization](#localization) part of the [headers & footers](#headers--footers) chapter.

___

### Localization
It is possible to use different localization with the same headers and/or footers but __not required__.  
If you want to support only one language then you should "hardcode" the content of the header or footer to the representing json and it should work perfectly. In that case you do not have to use the placeholders object (see [stucture](#structure)).  
If you want to support more than one language, then you have to use the placeholders object. You should not write the actual content to the json instead you should use a placeholder (for example if you have a title element in your header or footer, then the text of the title should be the placeholder instead of the actual content. We will replace the placeholders in our application). You can give any kind of name to this placeholder, but it should begin and end with two '#' character (for example: ##title##.). After that you have to insert the placeholder to the placeholders object as follows: the key should be the name of the placeholder, and the value should be an object conatining the language code - value pairs of the actual content.  
Example placeholders object: 

	placeholders: { '##title##': {
				'en': 'The header is a good thing',
				'hu': 'A fejléc egy jó dolog',
				//...
			},
	 '##example-palceholder##: {
	 			'en': 'It is an example',
	 			'hu': 'Ez egy példa',
	 			//...
	 			}
	 }
	 
You can localize the name (title) of the headers and/or footers too. The title of a header or footer is the text which will appear on the dropdown list, where the user will be able to choose from them.  
If you want to support more than one language you just have to put the language code - text pair to the title object (see [structure](#structure)).
An example title object: 

	title: { 'en': 'example title',
		 'hu': 'példa cím'
		 /...
		}
		
If you support a language but you do not want to give the header or footer a different title in the other language, you do not have to, but please note that this way the default title will be used on the dropdown list for this header, and the default is always the 'en' (english) version of the title.  

Example:  
_We support the english and the hungarian languages. We upload two headers with the following two title objects: title: {'en': 'first 	header'} and title: {'en': 'second header', 'hu': 'Második fejléc'}. If someone select the hungarian language, then in his dropdown 		list there will be two selectable header: 'first header' and 'Második fejléc', but if someone choose the english version, then 		the dropdown list will look like the following: 'first header' and 'second header'._  

If you do not give an 'en' (english) title to a header, then it will be generated automatically in our application, so it is suggested to always upload an 'en' version of the title too.

___

Feature Switch
---------------
You can allow or forbid some features of our application to a group of your users.
The list of the features you can set at the moment:  
  - gallery {Object}: contains the features of the gallery
    - noUpload {Boolean} If you set this parameter true then the users belong to this group cannot use the upload functionality. If you configured the gallery noUploadText (see [gallery config](#configure-api-servers-gallery)) text then it will appear on the upload tab, otherwise a default text will be used.
    - noUrl {Bollean} If you set this parameter true, then the users of this group cannot use any image not hosted by you. The image from url tab of the gallery will disappear if the feature does not allowed.
    - limit {Number} The number of images the user can upload. If you do not want to set any limit then leave this parameter undefined. If a user reach the limit, then he won't be able to upload any more image and if you configured the gallery limitReached (see [gallery config](#configure-api-servers-gallery)) text then it will be displayed otherwise a default text will be used.  Please note that the 0 limit and the noUpload are almost equivalent except a different message will appear on the upload tab if you use one or the other.

This list is constantly expanding with time!
